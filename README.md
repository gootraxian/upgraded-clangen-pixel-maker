Hi! I'm katto and I edited the original page, so it became more user friendly and I could get a bigger scale on the output!

# To the clangen developers: If they see this:
This fork is ready to be merged with the main branch, as long as you remove the references to my name, I believe its fine, but please, give me credit!

![Preview of the website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gootraxian/upgraded-clangen-pixel-maker/refs/heads/main/Sprite.png "Preview")

Heres the original README.md:


# Pixel Cat Maker

Dollmaker that uses sprites from ClanGen.

> [!NOTE]
> I originally used Git LFS for this project, but I eventually decided against using it. However, you can't remove LFS storage objects from a repository on GitHub without recreating the repository. So I recreated the repository.

## Dev Requirements

- Node.js

## Dev Instructions

### Running and Building from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/cgen-tools/pixel-cat-maker.git
cd pixel-cat-maker
npm install
```

Split the sprites (only have to do this if the sprites change):
```
node scripts/build-sprites.js
```

To run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

To build:

```
npm run build
```

The site will be in the `dist` folder. Note that the built site won't run locally without a development server due to browser security policies. However, you should be able to upload it to [neocities](https://neocities.org) or any other static hosting site without a problem.

### Notes For Forks
* If using GitHub Actions to build and deploy the site, you have to go into `Settings > Pages` and make sure that `Source` under `Build and deployment` is set to `GitHub Actions`. Otherwise, GitHub will deploy the unprocessed HTML files, which won’t work. 

### Updating JSON Files

Unlike with ClanGen, even if you're just modifying the JSON files, you have to build from source. You _cannot_ (easily) modify the JSON files from the built site because the JSON data is transformed into Javascript objects during the build process for optimization.

JSON files only affect the _sprite renderer_ (i.e. the code that draws the sprite to the screen). They do not affect the options available on the website. To change the website, you must modify `index.json` and/or `src/main.ts`.

#### spritesIndex.json:

This file maps sprite group names to their spritesheet file and pixel offset. This allows you to use ClanGen-compatible spritesheets without modification, but it requires some preprocessing if you're adding any new sprites.

Currently, the simplest way to update this file is to modify ClanGen's `make_group()` function in `sprites.py`, then run the game normally (I'm sorry). Here's a quick example:

```py
#scripts/cat/sprites.py

def make_group(...):
  group_x_ofs = pos[0] * sprites_x * self.size
  group_y_ofs = pos[1] * sprites_y * self.size

  if not no_index:
      # You should set self.group_info = {} in the constructor
      self.group_info[name] = {
          "spritesheet": spritesheet,
          "xOffset": group_x_ofs,
          "yOffset": group_y_ofs
      }

# Later, write self.group_info to a JSON file
# This file will be spritesIndex.json
```

The April Fools' lineart is added to the JSON manually because it's not loaded regularly unless it's April Fools':
```json
  "aprilfoolslineart": {
    "spritesheet": "aprilfoolslineart",
    "xOffset": 0.0,
    "yOffset": 0.0
  },
  "aprilfoolslineartdead": {
    "spritesheet": "aprilfoolslineartdead",
    "xOffset": 0.0,
    "yOffset": 0.0
  },
  "aprilfoolslineartdf": {
    "spritesheet": "aprilfoolslineartdf",
    "xOffset": 0.0,
    "yOffset": 0.0
  }
```

#### white_patches_tint.json and tint.json

These are the same as the files that can be found in ClanGen under `sprites/dicts`. They're necessary because they define the exact tint colours and blending modes.

You should only replace these files if you added or changed any tints.

#### spritesOffsetMap.json

This file is used to map sprite numbers to their x and y offset in the sprite group.

You probably do not have to touch this.

#### peltInfo.json

This represents various data that's necessary to retrieve the correct sprite group.

Mostly, it specifies accessory types and scar type. If you added any new scars and accessories, you have to put them here as well. Otherwise, the site won't be able to find them.
